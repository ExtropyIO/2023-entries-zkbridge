## 2. Judging

Your implementation will be reviewed with respect to the following criteria:

1. Correctness of the implementation.
2. Efficiency of the implementation (in the case of e.g. a novel circuit implementation)
3. Quality of the documentation.

You are required to supply tests that evaluate the correctness of your implementation.

### Mid-Season Progress Check-in
